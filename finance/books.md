## Inside the Black Box: A Simple Guide to Quantitative and High-Frequency Trading, 2nd Edition

P/E: the price-to-earnings ratio is the proportion of a company's share price to its earnings per share.

* p.7: Quants typically make markets more efficient for other participants by providing liquidity when other traders' needs cause a temporary imbalance in the supply and demande for a security. (...) Riskless profit, or arbitrage, is not the only-or even primary- way in which quants improve efficiency. The main inefficiencies quants eliminate (and, thereby, profit from) are not absolute and unassailable,  but rather are probabilistic and require risk taking. (example: statistical arbitrage)
* p.10: Discretionary investors often find it very difficult to realize losses, whereas they are quick to realize gains. This is a well-documented behavioral bias known as the disposition effect.
* p.13: One Washington Post article: "A quant fund is a hedge fund that relies on complex and sophisticated mathematical algorithms to search for anomalies and non-obvious patterns in the markets".
* p.14: Statistical arbitrage is based on the theory that similar instruments should behave similarly. If their relative prices diverge over the short run, they are likely to converge again. So long as the stocks are still similar, the divergence is more likely due to a short-term imbalance between the amount of buying and selling of these instruments, rather than any meaningful fundamental change that would warrant a divergence in prices. It also happens to be a strategy that diescrtionary traders use, though it is usually called *pairs trading*.
* p.16: Many quants reserve the right to reduce the overall size of the portfolio (and therefore leverage) if, in their discretion, the markets appear too risky. For example, after the attacks of September 11, 2001, many quants reduced their leverage in the wake of a massive event that would have unknowable repercussions on capital markets. Once things seemed to be operating more normally in the markets, the quants increased their leverage back to normal levels.
* p.16: If both the qeustions of *what positions* to own and *how much* of each to own are usually answered systematically, that's a quant. If either one is answered by a human as standard operating procedure, that's not a quant.
* p.17: The trading system has three modules-an alpha model, a risk model, and a transaction cost model-which fed into a portfolio construction model, which in turn interacts with the exectuion model.
