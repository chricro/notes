This website, currently under construction, is an organised compilation of notes on a variety of subjects, including statistical learning {% include sidenote.html id="note-pgm" note="Statistical learning $$\approx$$ statistics + machine learning" %}, generative artificial intelligence, and finance.

## Statistical learning

*Statistical learning* involves a collection of techniques designed to analyze and interpret complex datasets. This emerging field within statistics integrates closely with advancements in computer science, especially machine learning. It includes a variety of methods like lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, as well as boosting and support vector machines. The surge in *Big Data* challenges has significantly heightened the relevance of statistical learning across various scientific fields, in addition to financial sectors.

Here is a synthesis of various elements I learned from Machine Learning courses at Télécom SudParis (2020-2022) and Imperial College London (2022-2023). I aim to keep explanations concise, so this is not an exhaustive list.

- [Supervised learning](machine_learning/supervised_learning/): Generative approache (LDA/GDA, Naive Bayes) vs discriminant approach (logistic regression).
- [Unsupervised learning](machine_learning/unsupervised_learning/): Dimension reduction (PCA, Kernel PCA). Unsupervised clustering (K-means, K-medoids). Latent data (EM algorithm).

## Generative AI

Here are some notes on Generative AI that I wrote while working full-time at a startup.

- [An overview of large language models](ai/llm/): Pretraining, instruction fine-tuning, alignment techniques. Frameworks to deploy LLMs efficiently, optimization of inference. How to improve reasoning. Vision transformers.
- [Useful resources](ai/resources/): Benchmarks and leaderboards, interesting blogs and github resources.

## Finance

As someone eager to apply my statistical and machine learning knowledge to practical problems and real-world scenarios, I find finance to be a fascinating field for research and exploration.

1. [Book Excerpts](finance/books/): Here are extracts from books that I find interesting and educational, as well as areas I am willing to explore.
